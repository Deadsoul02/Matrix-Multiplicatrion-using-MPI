In code folder we have 6 files.
Serial_matrix_multiplication.py consist of simple python code to generate 100*100 matrixs and multiplies both matrix 
Parallel_matrix_multiplication.py is python file which calculate Matrix mltiplication using MPI for 100*100 matrix
Graph_table.ipynb consist of jupyter python code to make Graph and  Table
Serial-loop-2.py has same code has simple serial code but it calulates Matrix of size 300 -3000 in loop
Parallel-loop-2.py has same code has simple parallel code but it calulates Matrix of size 300-3000 in loop
mpi-test.py consist of simple MPI code
